/*
Exercise 9.1: Add a functionWithdraw(amount int) boolto thegopl.io/ch9/bank1program.
The result should indicate whether the transaction succeeded or failed due to insufficient funds.
The message sent to the monitor goroutine must contain both the amount to withdraw and a new channel over which the monitor goroutine can send the boolean result back toWithdraw.
